# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Title
Affiliate Management Platform Website

## Overview
Build a web-based platform to manage affiliate partners, streamline registration, and provide both partners and administrators with the tools needed for effective affiliate program management. The platform will be divided into three main sections: Registration Interface, Affiliate Partner Backend, and Affiliate Management Interface. Data tracking is not required at this stage.

## Goals
- Enable new users to register and log in securely
- Provide affiliate partners with a dashboard, access to links, creatives, and payment info
- Allow management to oversee affiliates, materials, and payment records
- Deliver a fully functional operational platform (no data tracking required yet)

## Features & Requirements

### 1. Registration Interface
- User registration form (account, password, required info)
- Secure login/logout functionality
- Store registration info in the system for later use
- Basic validation and error handling

### 2. Affiliate Partner Backend Interface
- Dashboard with summary of key data (e.g., earnings, clicks, conversions)

### 3. Affiliate Management Interface (Admin)

- Backend with authentication and data storage (Node.js, Express, or similar)
